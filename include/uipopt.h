/**
 * Appication specific configurations
 *
 * An uIP application is implemented using a single application function that is
 * called by uIP whenever a TCP/IP event occurs. The name of this function must
 * be registered with uIP at compile time using the UIP_APPCALL definition.
 *
 * uIP applications can store the application state within the uip_conn
 * structure by specifying the type of the application structure by typedef:ing
 * the type uip_tcp_appstate_t.
 *
 * The file containing the definitions must be included in the uipopt.h file.
 *
 * The following example illustrates how this can look.
 \code

void httpd_appcall(void);
#define UIP_APPCALL     httpd_appcall

struct httpd_state {
  uint8_t state;
  uint16_t count;
  char *dataptr;
  char *script;
};
typedef struct httpd_state uip_tcp_appstate_t
 \endcode
 */


/**
 * \var #define UIP_APPCALL
 *
 * The name of the application function that uIP should call in
 * response to TCP/IP events.
 *
 */


/**
 * \var typedef uip_tcp_appstate_t
 *
 * The type of the application state that is to be stored in the
 * uip_conn structure. This usually is typedef:ed to a struct holding
 * application state information.
